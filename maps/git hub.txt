Try this:
In the GitHub App, create new repo
Install eGit from the Eclipse Marketplace.
It will install all of the dependencies.
Click Import...
Click Projects from Git.
Select Local
Select your local repository.
Copy all of the ROTMG_Releases sources to the new Repository.
Do an Initial Commit(Right click-> Team-> Commit) to upload the sources to the server.


This is the simplest path that I know of *teehee*
